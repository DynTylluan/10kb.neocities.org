		<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>Come one and all to the <strong>artists</strong> who make this site a reality, as opposed to the pipe dream of a furry fuck with time to burn and no other ambitions in life than to inform the anonymous public about his opinions on art. Bear witness to the entire brunt of what humanity can produce. There is no discrimination here — we have people of all colours! Except for black. Black isn't a colour.</p>
			<p>Ever wanted to know more about the kind creators who populate this site? Here's your page. All sorted alphabetically for your pleasure, every artist featured on this gallery has information about who they are and what they do. And you know what? That artist could be <em>you</em>. Yes, you, <em>Cherry</em>. You're probably not reading this, but if you are, I'm sorry.</p>
