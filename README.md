# Mirror of The 10kB Gallery (10kb.neocities.org)
As stated in 2017 by Froge, [The 10kB Gallery](https://10kb.neocities.org) (to quote the about page) is a "website [that] is a celebration of positive cultural trends, while providing a thrashing against the negative ones. This website celebrates small filesizes and reasonable design, creating not just a website that is beautiful to look at, but whose code is just as excellent. The gallery shows how much can be made with ten kilobytes, an amount equivalent to poverty in today's world, and how much there is to appreciate in the art of optimisations. The result is a website that can be shown in less than a second on dial–up — including pictures."

As with other projects made by Froge, the website and all of the contents have been put into the license of CC0 1.0 Universal, effectually meaning that anyone is welcome to edit, use or sell the source code and images on the site free of charge without asking for permission.

# Disclaimer Regarding This Project
Just because I have mirrored a project by another person, this **does not mean** in any way, shape, or form that I agree or support the views of this project or even the person who made it, I have simply mirrored it for historical reasons as I have an interest in digital preservation. Over the years I have taken the time to archive many items, much of which can be seen [on my Internet Archive user page](https://archive.org/details/@14jammar). Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard text that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or is untrustworthy.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not affect the main part of the project in any way.
