			<p>People, people. Do not adjust your browsers — the space is supposed to be a little bit… corrupted. What you're bearing witness to is the world's tiniest gif, and most likely the smallest image in the world.</p>
			<p>Yeah, that's pretty much it. There's a difference between creating something remarkable because of the circumstances of its creation, and the end product that comes out of it. A 1×1 GIF that won't even load half the time? Riveting.</p>
			<p>Also obligatory pimp for the <a href="../artists/u.html#unknownartist">Tomb of the Unknown Artist</a>. There are people out there (cough) who make work that strikes that just right balance between being a clever hack and still being astonishing. This unknown artist just hacked away with no regard for human life. They set out to do what they accomplished… but at what cost?</p>
			<p>The cost is pissing off my audience by being devoid of any actual content. See you tomorrow!</p>
