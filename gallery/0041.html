			<p>Oh, no. By Chaos itself, have mercy on me. Out of all the possibilities that are being presented to the amassment of sensory information that makes up the entity known as me, I am not entertaining the possibility of staying up until 02:00 editing somebody else’s work. I’m not going to have a seizure like those kids who die playing Starcraft.</p>
			<p>Why can’t I plan my entires in advance like I did when I first started this gallery? Is it because I keep spending time finding the best of the best work that I want on my blog, when I eventually realise that such time eventually leads to no work being made at all? Is it because I spend more time on nonsense than I bargain for? Is it because I keep eating dinner hours before I actually go to bed, and thus feel sleepy the whole time?</p>
			<p>Asking these questions is taking up the time I would spend sleeping. I wish there was some old piece of art I made way back when so that I can create as simple as an update as I may.</p>
			<p>Oh, I’m im <a href="00.html">second in this row</a>?  Already? So that can only mean one thing…</p>
			<p>Happy Flag Frogeday, where we once again drag some shitty symbolism out of the depths of Hell for your viewing pleasure. Today there is none. It was made for a <a href="https://lilyblossom.neocities.org/">horse</a>, and here’s the <a href="source/0041blomtradgard.xcf">source</a>. Anyway, that’s Flag Frogeday, hope you enjoyed it. Also, stay tuned for my inevitable dream journal, in which I knock out a movie attendent for no adequately explained reason only to come back five minutes later like nothing had ever happened but still feel ashamed when he smiles at me.</p>
			<p>Note: the dream journal was a joke. These dreams are copyrighted. No stealing [RAUCIOUS LAUGHTER OUTSIDE THE STUDIO COMMENCES].</p>
