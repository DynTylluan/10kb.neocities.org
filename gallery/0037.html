			<h3 class="smallcaps">Another Conversation with Froge:</h3>
				<p class="smallcaps">This is a flag for strata, because I like strata!</p>
				<p class="smallcaps">I made it. If you look closely to the flag, you can see there are the letters "STRATA"!</p>
				<p class="smallcaps">I don't like the flag, because this is a self-deprecating joke!</p>
				<p class="smallcaps">I also like <em>really small</em> file sizes, and really <strong>BIG</strong> upscales! So big, you need to step back from your monitor to see what is actually going on!</p>
				<p class="smallcaps">Also, images are not the only things I like upscaled big <b>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</b></p>
				<p class="smallcaps">I have a very strong opinion over how technology should be used. For example, I don't like windows, and embedded css.</p>
				<p class="smallcaps"><strong>WELL WHAT'S NEXT, THE SKY ISN'T BLUE? YOU'RE A DISAGREE TO THE FAMILY.</strong> Bill gates can suck my fresh cock. The end.</p>
			<h3 class="smallcaps">Suddenly - A Gun Shotte</h3>
				<p>Oh, Christ. Sorry about that, I had forgotten where I put my special gun for <a href="https://joppiesaus.neocities.org/frogy10kbmim.html">special people</a>, as they temporarily invaded my domain and thus “P0WNED,” my, “A$$,” as the cool kids would say.</p>
				<p>The real update is at <a href="0038.html">0038</a>. I present the above nonsense with no comment. It deserves none.</p>
