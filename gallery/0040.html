      <p>Oh, what’s this? We’re extending the “colourful” theme for another five days? Well, why not, then! Better than the dreary whiteness we had before all of this, which some would call “minimalist” and which I call a waste of photoreceptors.</p>
			<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls Volume Number One. From one to nine is Tikal the Echnida, and number ten is Tails the Inbred Fox. Anyway, that’s my view of the Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls Volume Number One, I hope you enjoyed Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls, remember to leave a like, subscribe if you like my videos about Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls, hit that little bell on the right there, and remember to enter my Patreon for more Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls videos, where I do a raffle once a month to determine the Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls. See you later, Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls bros.</p>
			<p>In all seriously, I picked a tremendously bad time to update this image. Right now I’m living exclusively off of strawberry shortcake and poorly–compressed vaporwave, which is further compounded by me spending the last hour hacking together this image to get it Just Right™. You see, this is one of those images which weren’t just me indexing the colours and calling it a day. I had to actually work for it.</p>
			<p>When I originally knocked the image down to 16 colours, it looked bloody awful. The shading was all wrong. Tikal looked like melted plastic. The skirt was undignified; it looked like clown vomit. Only a little bit better at 32, it was, but she did lose a lot of her golden glow. I like that glow. So I was forced to start at 64 and, manually, remove colours and replace them with more common ones in order to reduce the amount of colours to the fabled 16.</p>
			<p>There’s no special reason for it to be 16 colours, the same as there’s no special reason for it to be 32 or 64. Certainly, the less colours, the more space is saved, but the law of diminishing returns states there’s not as much benefit to reducing colours than there is in having the image indexed at all. They are, essentially, lucky numbers: powers of two that computer scientists use because it makes them feel good.</p>
			<p>I’m going to invent a law called “Trout’s law”, which is a good a name as any because I’m waiting to attach my name to a real gucci law, like one saying you can’t drive a tank through a church. Trout’s law states that, as the amount of irrelevent details a digital artist adds increases, so does the likelihood they’re overcompensating for lack of talent. It happens to be named after <a href="../artists/t.html#trout">Trout</a>, who is a really great artist, not because they attempt to blind people with technical skill, but because they’re sincere in everything they draw. That’s ten times more important than being able to lovingly render every hair on a fat furry rump.</p>
			<p>(this law can also be referred to as “Carmack’s Inverse”; as the amount of mechanics in a video game increase, so does the likelihood the game will be shit. both Carmack and Trout prove the negative is true, as anybody who’s played Quake can attest)</p>
			<h3>Moshi Moshi Goshaag Desu</h3>
				<p>Fans of 10kB will notice thsat Trout is <em>not</em> the artist of the picture… that honour goes to <a href="../artists/g.html#goshaag">Goshaag</a>, which is an artist’s page I’m obliged to create despite being brained out of my mind. Thanks, Tikal. Without spoiling too much about this artist who I am almost certain to feature again, Goshaag really is one of my favourite artists out there. He was damn good before his style change, and he’s damn better after. I’m not just saying that because he dropped the antialiasing; he’s always strived to have a mastery over colour and character, and I think pieces like this are helping him do just that.</p>
				<p>Not coincidentally, he embodies the Unix philosophy perfectly, like most good things that end up having nothing to do with Unix whatsoever.	He only draws a few characters, mostly from Freedom Planet and other thinly–disguised games for furries, but he draws them so well and with such creativity that there’s really nothing to complain about. While his work isn’t always “on–model” as it were, everything he does is so fresh and apparently effortless that not only is his style completely distinctive, but one also gets the feeling that there is nothing but sincerity behind everything he does.</p>
				<p>You must remember that it is better to do a few things <em>extremely well</em> than it is to do a lot of things and not excel in any of them. It is true that specialisation is for insects… but at the same time, there are benefits to being extremely good in a few areas of expertise. I suppose the takeaway is to be able to do everything competently and a few things extracompetently.</p>
				<p>If given all the cake and vaporwave in the world, I would go on for paragraphs more. But I don’t. So all I will leave you with is my Top Ten Hottest Sonic Anime Girls Volume Number One. From one to nine is Tikal the Echnida, and number ten is Tails the Inbred Fox.
