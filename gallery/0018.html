			<h3>Wow hey the source is NSFW.</h3>
			<p>“Wow, Froge has <em>really</em> set the bar low for this blog lately,” you say, as I slowly walk up behind you with a suspicious–looking handkerchief while wearing a T–shirt saying “Just Fuck my Shit Up and Also I Love my Wife and the Canadian Armed Forces”, with a poorly–compressed picture of Renamon and Krystal holding turkey basters and trying to physically inflate each other while wearing ninja costumes. It is never specified which is my wife.</p>
			<p>Fair enough, I suppose, given how it’s <em>another</em> one of those posts where you JPEG to win. I thought the <a href="0005.html">Iranian dude</a> would have been enough for one lifetime, but nope! All the other art on my PC is furry stuff, and I gotta bring some balance to this website before I get blocked in Germany, so <a href="https://strata.neocities.org/">Strata</a> can finish his morning routine. By the way Strata, I can’t fulfill your T–shirt order this week on account of somebody being murdered in it. Or on it.</p>
			<p>So imagine my pleasant surprise to have bore witness to this masterpiece by none other than… <strong>Pegawolf?</strong> No! The furry menace returns — wait, she changed her name to <a href="../artists/m.html#missbutler">Miss Butler</a>. Let’s just ignore her furry comic and her axolotl boyfriend, which 2011 bornies will rememeber as All Levels at Once. <em>No! The curse returns!</em></p>
			<p>Why would I feature this nonsense instead of one of her other fabulous works? Well, there was that one period of time where I made a <a href="https://froghand.neocities.org/presidentberries.html">3,000 word review</a> of the work in one day. Then two days later I made an <a href="https://froghand.neocities.org/thespongebobsquarepantsthemoviethegamethereview.html">8,000 word review</a> of Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie: The Game. That review had everything; an escape from ISIS, the satiricisation of Christian dogma, TAS–level tech, a dissertation on level design, and a brief overview of the scripting syntax for Earthbound.</p>
			<p>Froghand… Froghand was an experience.</p>
