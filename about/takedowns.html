		<h2>And info regarding:</h2>
			<p>In ninety–nine percent of cases, <strong>we don't honour takedown requests.</strong> Now if you want to find out <em>why,</em> you'll have to read the <a href="../about.html">about pages</a>, because corporate lawyers have such a good sense of humour.</p>
			<p>If you're an artist who is honoured with the privilege of my notice, then that means that, above all else, you are an artist whose work deserves to be shared. It means you're a good artist — and not just a good artist, but a <em>great</em> one. For somebody like me, with a standard of quality earned over years of seeing the best the world has to offer, to take your work and show it to the world, is indeed a privilege that so few people earn.</p>
			<p>When you say to me and my audience, "I don't want my work to be seen, I don't want to be praised, I don't want free advertising, I don't want to be known, I don't want to be famous, I don't want to be an inspiration, I don't want more commissioners, I don't want to be somebody who other people look up to,"… why did you become an artist at all? You can do personal work, and if it's truly personal, why would you share it?</p>
			<p>The fact of the world, and I'm sorry for having to tell you this, is that culture doesn't stop just because the person who makes that culture says it does. For somebody to make something that the world enjoys, and then take it away from the world because they don't want it to be seen, is against the whole point of making art. It just doesn't fit what artists are supposed to be like. It doesn't help anybody — not the artist, and especially not their fans.</p>
			<p>But if you want to be an artist, and I know you want to be an artist because of the extraordinarily good work you do, then you can't expect to be both a good person, and have total control over everything you do. Because the copyright you have is, in reality, a copy privilege. People are free to ignore it if it benefits everybody else; in fact, I am ignoring it. It benefits everybody else.</p>
			<p><a href="http://copyheart.org/">Copying is an act of love</a>, and so is making new work out of those copies. If you're still not convinced, and if you really don't want to be the person that you've spent so much of your life working towards being, then send an e–mail to <strong>10kb@protonmail.ch</strong>, and make an <em>incredibly good case</em> as to why you want my work removed. Don't be lazy, don't get mad, and <em>especially</em> don't threaten any legal action. I'm not your lawyer, so I'm not going to tell you why, but the long and short of it is that what we're doing is 100% legal.</p>
			<p>Takedown notices sent through any other means will be ignored, and abuse of the system will lead to being blocked. Thank you.</p>
